1. a0-a7; a2;
2. No such codes. g() has been inlined into f(), and f() has been inlined into main().
3. 0x0000000000000628, main calls it with pc-relative addressing.
4. 0x0000000000000038, next line of assembly right after the jalr.
5. HE110 World; i=0x726c6400; No, because 57616 is E110 in hex regardless of endianness.
6. A random value depending on what codes there are right before the call.Because printf tried to read more arguments than supplied.
   The second argument `3` is passed in a1, and the register for the third argument, a2, is not set to any specific value before the
   call, and contains whatever there is before the call and will be printed.
